{"name":"Solr sparse faceting","tagline":"Fast high cardinality faceting for small result sets","body":"### Sparse faceting for Solr\r\nThis project is for the [SOLR-5894](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/SOLR-5894) patch.\r\n\r\nSparse faceting is used with high-cardinality String fields, such as _author_ or _title_. Standard Solr _fc_-faceting scales with the (variable) result size as well as the (fixed) number of unique values in the facet fields. Sparse faceting scales with the result size only, meaning that the smaller the result set is, the faster faceting will be. For single-shard indexes, sparse is faster when the result set is < ~8% of the total number of documents in the index. For multi-shard indexes, the cut-off point is higher than that.\r\n\r\nAny questions? Feel free to contact Toke Eskildsen, te@statsbiblioteket.dk","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
